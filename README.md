# VIPE-Enhanced-Wallpaper-Release
Simple API for Wallpapers Generation

Dear Community,

We are pleased to announce the launch of a new API designed to simplify the creation of wallpapers. This API facilitates the generation of wallpapers by allowing users to input a VIPE number and subsequently randomizing the pose until a desired one is achieved.

We believe that this API will greatly enhance the user experience by providing a streamlined approach to wallpaper creation, offering both efficiency and flexibility.

Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to your feedback as we continue to improve and expand upon this offering.
